This repo for the [ggbiplot package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggbiplot)
was forked from [https://github.com/vqv/ggbiplot](https://github.com/vqv/ggbiplot) by Vince Yu, which has been dormant
since 2015.  

The goal is to complete that development and publish a new version on CRAN.
There is also an [experimental branch](https://github.com/friendly/ggbiplot/tree/experimental) which attempts to
simplify the code, but this has some unresolved problems.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

# ggbiplot <img src="man/figures/logo.png" height="200" style="float:right; height:200px;"/>

An implementation of the biplot using `ggplot2`.  The package provides two functions: `ggscreeplot()` and `ggbiplot()`.
`ggbiplot` aims to be a drop-in replacement for the built-in R function `biplot.princomp()` with extended functionality 
for labeling groups, drawing a correlation circle, and adding Normal probability ellipsoids.


Installation
------------

Install the current master branch with:

```r
remotes::install_github("friendly/ggbiplot")
```

Example Usage
-------------
The `wine` data contains results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy,
derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the 
quantities of 13 chemical constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 
The grape varieties (cultivars), 'barolo', 'barbera', and 'grignolino', are given in `wine.class`.

What can we understand about the differences among these wines from a biplot?

```{r wine-screeplot}
library(ggbiplot)
library(ggplot2)
data(wine)
wine.pca <- prcomp(wine, scale. = TRUE)
ggscreeplot(wine.pca)
```


Plot the first two PCA dimensions:
```{r wine-biplot}
ggbiplot(wine.pca, 
  obs.scale = 1, var.scale = 1,
  groups = wine.class, 
  ellipse = TRUE, 
  circle = TRUE) +
  labs(fill = "Cultivar", color = "Cultivar") +
  theme(legend.direction = 'horizontal', legend.position = 'top')
```

Description: A 'ggplot2' based implementation of biplots, giving a representation of a dataset in
    a two dimensional space accounting for the greatest variance, together with variable vectors
    showing how the data variables relate to this space. It provides a 
    replacement for stats::biplot(), but with many enhancements to control the analysis and
    graphical display. It implements 
    biplot and scree plot methods which can be used with the results of prcomp(), princomp(),
    FactoMineR::PCA(), ade4::dudi.pca() or MASS::lda() and can be customized using 'ggplot2' techniques.
